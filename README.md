# QikServe Challenge

## Challenge scope

I programmed for this challenge an app to make order for a restaurant. As can I analyze the json data
you made available for me.
This app consists of 4 basic steps:
  1 - Show the menu.
  2 - Choose the item and it quantity.
  3 - Place the order.
  4 - Checkout the bill.

## The layout

After analyze your business for a few days I was inspired to make a layout close to your app.
I prioritized the mobile layout have in mind that access to the site via cellphone has been growing
gradually.


## Next steps

 * Register the order in a database via Nodejs (API).
 * Adapt layout for larger devices.
